# Solar Interconnection & Local Elections

This project explores how local elections relate to the timing of solar permit applications. It includes:

- `PreliminaryAnalysis.ipynb`: Prepares a merged dataset of solar interconnection applications and county-level election results, including election and member change flags.

- `CreatingFigures.ipynb`: Creates visualizations of application timing around elections, comparing trends in election years, the year before (lead), and the year after (lag).

Plots are used to support the research prospectus and illustrate patterns in application behavior across electoral cycles.
